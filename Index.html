                <h1>C.A.R.P. TASK</h1>

                <P>C.A.R.P. stands for Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity. The following posters
                    have been included in the design of these posters. I have designed 3 different posters
                    for the True/False Festival in Misouri. I have used Adobe Indesign to create these 3
                    advertisement pieces, although tricky at first I now have a basic understanding of the
                    software.

            <h1>TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS</h1>

            <P>In Design there are 8 different types of typographic systems they are Axial, Bilateral, Dilatational,
                Grid, Modular, Radial, Random and Transitional. Below are 8 different images of examples of the systems
                used to advertise the The Arnolfini International Centre for Contemporary Arts, and the work of the
                painter Sir Frank Bowling. We used Adobe Illustrator for creating the images.
            </P>
            
            <div class="media-container">
                <img src= "https://placebear.com/300/300">
                <div class="typomediacontent">Axial is where the text is aligned left or right down either side of a central line.
                    Here I have showed that and added in a bit of contrast by using the blue on one side.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="media-container">
                <img src= "https://placebear.com/300/300">
                <div class="typomediacontent">Bilateral is like Axial, however instead of being on either side, the text is centred down the middle.
                You can use this formula multiple times on one page however I have just used it once, I have used the
                text at different sizes to show hierarchy of the information.</div>
            </div>
            <img src= "https://placebear.com/300/300">
            <p>Dilatational involves the use of circles and text is wrapped around an invisible circle. I feel that
                this style of system goes well with rounded shapes, so I have used circles and I like the design of
                this as it is simple yet effective.</p>

            <img src= "https://placebear.com/300/300">
            <p>Grid is as it sounds, there is an invisible grid on the screen and the text lines itself up within the
                grid even though the rest of the other shapes don’t necessarily follow the same grid. I used different
                tones of the blue to create a bit more dimension.</p>

            <img src= "https://placebear.com/300/300">
            <p>Modular is a repetitive use of the same shape/design in the same image to create unity. I have used
                hexagons for this and have the text inside, I have also included other hexagons in the design to tie
                the text together.</p>

            <img src= "https://placebear.com/300/300">
            <p>Radial can be described like rays from the sun, the text comes out from round a centre point of alignment.
                I have used circles to create a bubbly look and feel it works well with the system.</p>

            <img src= "https://placebear.com/300/300">
            <p>Transitional is not widely used and resembles much like layers of the earth or flowing like a river. I
                have tried to re-create the river look by using blue rectangles as well as the blue in the background of
                the design.</p>

            <img src= "https://placebear.com/300/300">
            <p>Random has no clear typographical system, there is no order to it and the text doesn’t have to be legible.
                I have used a series of random hexagons in different sizes and tones to carry on this theme. The text
                itself I have used a few different techniques to make it even more random.</p>
