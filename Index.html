        <p class="TopParagraph"> Welcome to my first Website! My name is Laura and I have never coded my own website before,
            this is the first time I have done something like this. I have created this website to show the things I have 
            learned while studying Graphic and Web Design in my first Year at University. This website will include 3 poster
            designs, 8 different typography systems, User experience with the website and a link to my GitHub Webpage to view
            other websites I have designed.

                <h1>C.A.R.P. TASK</h1>

                <P>C.A.R.P. stands for Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity. The following posters
                    have been included in the design of these posters. I have designed 3 different posters
                    for the True/False Festival in Misouri. I have used Adobe Indesign to create these 3
                    advertisement pieces, although tricky at first I now have a basic understanding of the
                    software.

                <div class="media-containercarp">
                    <img src="Images/CARPSubtle.png" width="300" height= "450">
                    <img src="Images/CARPImageLoaded.png" width="300" height= "450">

                </div>


                <div class="media-containercarp">
                    <div class="carpmediacontent">  I have created a more simplistic look with this poster to try and show off the images a
                        bit more. I have used a colour for the background that compliments both the images. I have centred everything down
                        the middle except the logo and website in the bottom right. This keeps symmetry across the page and everything looking tidy. 
                        I have repeated the same font throughout the page and kept with the white text, I have created contract by using the large text 
                        next to the small text showing hierarchy. There is some space on the outside of the poster to highlight the important 
                        information in the middle as well as making the poster simplistic.

                        </div>

                    <div class="carpmediacontent"> This poster has got a lot of things crammed into the page; it has got 5 images down the right-hand 
                        side showing the different things with the festival. I have kept a similar colour scheme on the left-hand side and tried to use 
                        a colour that can be reflected in the images on the right. I decided to use a gradient as I could not find an exact colour that 
                        would work. I have used contrast with the dark background and white text and have centre aligned the text with each other to 
                        create a uniformed look. I feel this piece doesn’t work as well because it is very crammed and could do with more white space.
                    
                    </div>
                    <div class="carpmediacontent"> I like this poster and it is the one I have spent more time on. I have kept the colours from the logo 
                        and designed the poster around this. The red in the image represents both an T and an F to symbolise this from the festival. I 
                        have aligned the text along the edges of the letter so that it all flows in a geometrical pattern. I have used white space at the 
                        bottom of the page so that It gives emphasis on the information in the centre of the poster. I originally had just plain black in 
                        the background at the top of the poster, but I have now added in text very subtly by using a gradient effect to add a bit more 
                        dimension into the poster. I have repeated the font and colours throughout the poster to keep it in unity. I feel this poster went 
                        well as it incorporates everything needed for this assignment as well as it being the most visually appealing. </div>

                <h1>TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS</h1>

                <P>In Design there are 8 different types of typographic systems they are Axial, Bilateral, Dilatational,
                    Grid, Modular, Radial, Random and Transitional. Below are 8 different images of examples of the
                    systems
                    used to advertise the The Arnolfini International Centre for Contemporary Arts, and the work of the
                    painter Sir Frank Bowling. We used Adobe Illustrator for creating the images.
                </P>



                <div class="media-container">
                    <img src="Images/TYPOAxial_Axial.png"width="300" height= "300">
                    <div class="typomediacontent">Axial is where the text is aligned left or right down either side of a
                        central line.
                        Here I have showed that and added in a bit of contrast by using the blue on one side.</div>

                        <img src="Images/TYPOBilateral_Bilateral.png"width="300" height= "300">
                    <div class="typomediacontent">Bilateral is like Axial, however instead of being on either side, the
                        text is centred down the middle.
                        You can use this formula multiple times on one page however I have just used it once, I have
                        used the
                        text at different sizes to show hierarchy of the information.</div>

                </div>


                <div class="media-container">
                    <img src="Images/TYPODilatational-11.png"width="300" height= "300">
                    <div class="typomediacontent">Dilatational involves the use of circles and text is wrapped around an
                        invisible circle. I feel that
                        this style of system goes well with rounded shapes, so I have used circles and I like the design
                        of
                        this as it is simple yet effective.</div>

                        <img src="Images/TYPOGrid_Grid.png"width="300" height= "300">
                    <div class="typomediacontent">Grid is as it sounds, there is an invisible grid on the screen and the
                        text lines itself up within the
                        grid even though the rest of the other shapes don’t necessarily follow the same grid. I used
                        different
                        tones of the blue to create a bit more dimension.</div>

                </div>


                <div class="media-container">
                    <img src="Images/TYPOModular_Modular.png"width="300" height= "300">
                    <div class="typomediacontent">Modular is a repetitive use of the same shape/design in the same image
                        to create unity. I have used
                        hexagons for this and have the text inside, I have also included other hexagons in the design to
                        tie
                        the text together.</div>

                        <img src="Images/TYPORadial_Radial.png"width="300" height= "300">
                    <div class="typomediacontent">Radial can be described like rays from the sun, the text comes out
                        from round a centre point of alignment.
                        I have used circles to create a bubbly look and feel it works well with the system.</div>

                </div>


                <div class="media-container">
                    <img src="Images/TYPOTransitional_Transitional.png"width="300" height= "300">
                    <div class="typomediacontent">Transitional is not widely used and resembles much like layers of the
                        earth or flowing like a river. I
                        have tried to re-create the river look by using blue rectangles as well as the blue in the
                        background of
                        the design.</div>
                
                        <img src="Images/TYPORandom_Random.png"width="300" height= "300">
                    <div class="typomediacontent">Random has no clear typographical system, there is no order to it and
                        the text doesn’t have to be legible.
                        I have used a series of random hexagons in different sizes and tones to carry on this theme. The
                        text itself I have used a few different techniques to make it even more random.</div>
                    </div>
                    </div>

        <section class="UX-Section">
            <div class="box3">

                <h1>UX TASK</h1>

                <P>My goal for my website was to create a page that showcased what I have learnt so far in my first year and semester 
                    at university. I have included 3 different designs for a poster focusing on contrast, alignment, repetition and proximity; 
                    the 8 systems of typography and examples of each; as well as the journey I have had so far. The target is to create the 
                    website so it can be viewed by Mary and Mic but also to show friends/family and future potential employers the website.
                    It will be a scrolling website with all the information on the one page, it will have multiple images to show the different 
                    things I have learned as well as being examples. I want to make this project successful by having everything in it that is 
                    required, making it visually pleasing, and work smoothly.
                
                    I am hopefully going to make this a portfolio piece and continue adding to the website after it has been submitted to show 
                    off my work, as well as gradually improving the website to include new techniques. I will hopefully then be able to use 
                    this as a portfolio piece for future employers to view to see my work.
