            <h1>C.A.R.P. TASK</h1>

            <P>C.A.R.P. stands for Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity. The following posters
                have been included in the design of these posters. I have designed 3 different posters
                for the True/False Festival in Misouri. I have used Adobe Indesign to create these 3
                advertisement pieces, although tricky at first I now have a basic understanding of the
                software.

            <h1>TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS</h1>

            <P>In Design there are 8 different types of typographic systems they are Axial, Bilateral, Dilatational,
                Grid, Modular, Radial, Random and Transitional. Below are 8 different images of examples of the systems
                used to advertise the The Arnolfini International Centre for Contemporary Arts, and the work of the
                painter Sir Frank Bowling. We used Adobe Illustrator for creating the images.
